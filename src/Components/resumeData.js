      "bio": "My path to becoming a full stack web developer has been an exciting one! From my first day at Lambda School my mantra became 'I can, and I will do this!' That mantra drove me through the months of feeling as if I were drinking from a fire hose every single day. The amount of information and new skills that I was required to take on every day was mind-boggling. But, here I am a year later knowing how to design, connect, route, debug and so much more! I would not trade that experience for anything! I love what I am doing and the fact that I get to learn new things every day feeds the part of me that needs to be continually challenged. My background in the non-profit sector has provided me with lots of experience managing people and teams and I hope to incorporate this into my tech career.  In addition to web development, I own an Etsy shop that specializes in kawaii stationary, washi tape and planner supplies.  A few of my favorite things are: Cats üê± Reading üìö Coffee ‚òï Sanrio characters ‚ù§Ô∏è and, of course, Coding üë©‚Äçüíª ",
