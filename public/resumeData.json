My original carrer direction was law or social work but through a series of interesting turns I ended up with an MBA and being a minister - go figure that one! My background has provided me with lots of experience managing people and teams and I hope to  incorporate this into my tech career.  In addition to web development, I own an Etsy shop that specializes in kawaii stationary, washi tape and planner supplies.  A few of my favorite things are: Cats üê± Reading üìö Coffee ‚òï Sanrio characters ‚ù§Ô∏è and, of course, Coding üë©‚Äçüíª ",
